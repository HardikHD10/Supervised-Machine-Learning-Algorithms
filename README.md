## k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Demonstrates the k-NN algorithm, a non-parametric method used for classification and regression.

## Naive Bayes Classifier

Explores the Naive Bayes classifier, a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.

## Logistic Regression

Showcases the Logistic Regression algorithm, used for binary classification tasks.

## Linear Regression

Introduces Linear Regression, a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Random Forest Classifier

Covers the Random Forest classifier, an ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks.

## Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Pipelining

Demonstrates the concepts of Automated Machine Learning and pipelining techniques for efficient model building and evaluation.

## Environment Prediction Tasks

Various notebooks focus on predicting environmental factors like SO2 and Nitrogen Oxide levels.

## Setup and Usage
